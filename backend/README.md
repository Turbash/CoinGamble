# Backend For CoinGamble

## This is the backend for coin gambel

This is a simple backend logic which allows for images uploading as well as user authentication for my CoinGamble Website.

### Tech Stack

I have used a node js, express js backend here, multer has been used for image uploading. For database, I have used MongoDB database simply because i am most comfirtable with it. I used mongoose to connect to MongoDb.

### Two Roles

There are two type of users here, one the coin collectors and one the experts. Coin collectors log their coins to the app, like their details, upload photo. And then any of the experts, may evaluate the coin and assign it a value.
